# CLAUDE.md — WHM (Wormhole Messaging) Monorepo

## Protocol context

For Hydration protocol-level context (architecture, products, tokenomics, Omnipool mechanics), fetch the central context index via WebFetch:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galacticcouncil/hydration/main/CLAUDE.md`

It lists available reference documents and their raw GitHub URLs.

## Project overview

Cross-chain messaging infrastructure connecting EVM chains, Solana, and Hydration via Moonbeam. Three concerns:

1. **On-chain contracts** — upgradeable Solidity (Foundry) on Base/Moonbeam/Hydration/Ethereum + an Anchor program on Solana.
2. **Off-chain agents** — long-running TS services that publish/index/relay (`broadcaster`, `scan`, `mrelayer`).
3. **Shared tooling** — a crash-safe migration runner, shared chain/wallet/args utilities, and the `migrations/` top-level orchestration.

**Repo:** `galacticcouncil/whm`
**Toolchain:** TypeScript 5.7 (strict, ES2022), Node 23.x. Solidity via Foundry + Soldeer. Rust via Cargo + Anchor 0.32.
**Package manager:** pnpm 10 (workspaces; see [pnpm-workspace.yaml](pnpm-workspace.yaml)).

### Use cases

- **Oracle Relay** — Solana program reads Kamino Scope prices + SPL stake-pool rates, broadcasts via Wormhole to Moonbeam, which forwards to Hydration's on-chain oracle via XCM. Ethereum-source variant reads wstETH / apyUSD rates directly. See [docs/oracle/spec.md](docs/oracle/spec.md), [docs/oracle/schema.md](docs/oracle/schema.md).
- **Basejump** — Instant cross-chain token bridging between EVM chains and Hydration via Moonbeam. Fast-path settles in ~2 min against a pre-funded landing pool; slow Wormhole TokenBridge transfer replenishes (~13 min). See [docs/basejump/spec.md](docs/basejump/spec.md), [docs/basejump/schema.md](docs/basejump/schema.md).
- **Intents** — Hydration users get any NEAR-Intents-supported asset (BTC, ZEC, NEAR, …) via OneClick quotes. One Hydration extrinsic (`IntentEmitterWtt.swapAndBridge`) swaps the user's asset → WETH and bridges it via Moonbeam + Wormhole **TokenBridge** (`transferTokensWithPayload`, a single payload-3 message); on Ethereum a relayer (`mrelayer`) redeems the VAA at `IntentReceiver`, which unwraps WETH → native ETH and forwards it into the quote's `depositAddress`. This is the deployed **WTT** variant; a Basejump-pooled **BJP** alternative (`IntentEmitterBjp` → `IntentRouter`) exists for slow-finality sources but is not deployed for intents. See [docs/intents/spec.md](docs/intents/spec.md), [docs/intents/fee.md](docs/intents/fee.md), [docs/intents/relay-fee.md](docs/intents/relay-fee.md).

### Workspace members

Declared in [pnpm-workspace.yaml](pnpm-workspace.yaml):

```
common
chopsticks
contracts
crates/solana
agents/broadcaster
agents/scan
agents/quoter
agents/mrelayer
agents/nintent
```

**Agents declare ONLY runtime deps.** The TS toolchain — `typescript`, `tsx`, `esbuild`, `dotenv`, `@types/*` — lives in the **root** `package.json` and resolves from agent packages via upward `node_modules` lookup. Never add these as agent `devDependencies` (a package-specific type like `@types/pg` is the only acceptable exception). New agents follow the `broadcaster`/`scan` pattern: workspace member, runtime-deps-only `package.json`, esbuild bundle to `dist/index.js`, `node:NN-slim` Docker copying just the bundle, and a modular `src/` (`config` / `clients` / `watcher` / `api` / `endpoints` / `index`) — not one fat `index.ts`.

### Dependency graph

```
Level 0 (no internal deps):  common
Level 1:                      contracts        → @whm/common (workspace:*)
                              crates/solana    → (Rust only, no TS workspace deps; common is used by migrations/scripts indirectly)
Level 2:                      agents/broadcaster → @whm/common; consumes Solana IDL via sync-idl
                              agents/scan        → @whm/common; consumes EVM/Hydration ABIs at runtime
                              migrations/        → @whm/common (top-level orchestration; not a workspace pkg itself)
```

Cross-platform glue lives at the **migration** layer and the **IDL/ABI sync** layer — agents don't import platform source directly.

## Key patterns

- **Merged migrations.** Each deployable feature lives in a single migration folder under `migrations/definitions/<name>/`. Step files are linear `NNN-<verb>-<subject>[@<contract>].ts`, ordered: deploys → authorize → wire → config → ownership-transfer/renounce. Multi-chain migrations (basejump-base touches Base + Hydration) declare a `WalletContext` map; each step picks its wallet (`ctx.wallet.base`, `ctx.wallet.hydration`, etc.).
- **Env-driven dependencies (no `ctx.ref`).** If migration B needs an address from A's deployment, the operator copies it from `deployments/<env>/A.json` into `envs/<env>/B.env` as a config variable. B's step reads it as `ctx.env.SOME_ADDRESS`. State files are write-once audit records; never queried at runtime by other migrations.
- **PKs from env, not CLI.** Each migration declares `pks: ["PK_X", "PK_Y", …]` in its `index.ts`. Runner validates `process.env` has them before invoking `setup()`. `--pk` is NOT a flag.
- **Env contexts, not chain envs.** Env files are keyed by deployment context (`prod`, `fork`) — not by chain. A single `prod/basejump-base.env` holds all chain configs (RPC_BASE, RPC_HYDRATION). Variables are chain-prefixed where applicable.
- **State paths**: `deployments/<context>/<migration>.json`. One file per (env-context, migration) pair.
- **Renounced ownership is the prod end-state.** Every prod-ready migration ends in `transfer-ownership@*` (to a real custodian) or `renounce@*` (to `0x0`). After the migration completes, the state file is the immutable audit record.
- **Crash-safe.** State is persisted after each step. Resume by re-running the same command; reset a stage with `--from <step-name>`; pause early with `--pause-at <step-name>`.
- **Upgradeable contracts.** Solidity inherits OZ UUPS upgradeable patterns. Initialization is done in migration steps, not constructors.
- **Wormhole SDKs.** EVM uses `wormhole-solidity-sdk` (pinned via Soldeer). Solana uses Wormhole Core Bridge through Anchor. `mrelayer` agent uses `@wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine`.
- **Agent bundling.** `broadcaster`, `scan`, and `nintent` bundle to a single `dist/index.js` via esbuild (CJS, node platform; see [esbuild.config.mjs](esbuild.config.mjs)). Avoid top-level await / ESM-only constructs in their `src/`. Agents carry only runtime deps — esbuild, tsx, typescript, and dotenv come from the **root** package.json (see Workspace members).
- **IDL sync.** `broadcaster` consumes the Solana program's IDL — `pnpm run sync-idl` in `agents/broadcaster/` copies `crates/solana/target/idl/oracle_emitter.json` and `crates/solana/target/types/oracle_emitter.ts` into `agents/broadcaster/src/emitter/`. Re-run after Solana program changes.
- **Ops scripts.** `contracts/scripts/<feature>/` (EVM) and `crates/solana/scripts/<program>/` (Solana) hold one-shot `tsx`/`bash` entry points. They use the per-package `package.json` plus root `.env` for PKs.

## Testing guidelines

- **Solidity:** `pnpm --filter @whm/contracts test` (Foundry). Tests live in `contracts/test/` organized by feature subdir (`basejump/`, `oracles/`, `intents/`) + `mocks/`, `helpers/`, `integration/`, `utils/`.
- **Solana:** `pnpm --filter @whm/crates-solana test` (cargo test, no validator needed). For integration tests via `ts-mocha`, start a local validator first.
- **Agents:** No formal test suite. Validate via `pnpm dev` against a local fork/validator.
- **Migrations:** Run against `--env fork` first. The runner is idempotent — re-run picks up where it failed.

## Naming conventions

### Step file naming (inside `migrations/definitions/<migration>/`)

```
NNN-<verb>-<subject>[@<contract>].ts
```

Phases group naturally by NNN order:

1. **Deploys** — `001-deploy-<contract>.ts`. No `@` suffix.
2. **Authorize** — `NNN-authorize-<subject>@<contract>.ts`. Granting permissions.
3. **Wire** (cross-contract addresses) — `NNN-set-<thing>@<contract>.ts`. Storing one contract's address on another.
4. **Config** (per-asset / per-feature) — `NNN-set-<asset>-<thing>@<contract>.ts` or `NNN-register-<thing>@<contract>.ts`.
5. **Ownership** — `NNN-transfer-ownership@<contract>.ts` (to a custodian) or `NNN-renounce@<contract>.ts` (to `0x0`). Always last.

### Env var naming (inside `migrations/envs/<context>/<migration>.env`)

- Chain-prefixed: `RPC_<CHAIN>`, `CHAIN_ID_<CHAIN>`, `WORMHOLE_CORE_<CHAIN>`, `TOKEN_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>`, `WORMHOLE_ID_<CHAIN>`.
- Single-chain (Moonbeam-only XcmTransactor): unprefixed (`DESTINATION_PARA_ID`, `FEE_ASSET`, etc.).
- Asset-prefixed: `<ASSET>_<thing>` (e.g. `EURC_FEE_ASSET`, `PRIME_ASSET_ID_BYTES32`).
- Ownership: `<contract>_NEW_OWNER`.
- **PKs**: NOT in env files; live in shell env or root `.env`.

### Wallet keys (inside migration `WalletContext`)

Keys are chain names: `hydration`, `moonbeam`, `base`, `ethereum`, `solana`. Step files use `ctx.wallet.<chain>`.

## Commit & PR conventions

`scope: description` — lowercase, imperative, no period:

```
oracle: revoke ownership (immutable)
basejump: verify scripts
scan: onIngest hook
contracts: rename BasejumpBase to BasejumpCore
migrations: merge basejump-base
```

Common scopes: `oracle`, `basejump`, `intents`, `scan`, `contracts`, `crates`, `migrations`, `broadcaster`. Omit scope for repo-wide or generic changes.

## AI agent guidance

### Before editing any file

1. **Identify the package** the file belongs to and read its `package.json` for scripts and deps.
2. **Check `pnpm-workspace.yaml`** — agents are workspace members; their `package.json` lists runtime deps only, the TS toolchain is in the root.
3. **For TS:** check the root `tsconfig.json`; per-package `tsconfig.json` extends it.
4. **For contracts:** check `contracts/foundry.toml` and `contracts/remappings.txt` before adding imports.
5. **For the Solana program:** check `crates/solana/Anchor.toml`, `crates/solana/Cargo.toml`, and existing accounts under `crates/solana/programs/oracle-emitter/src/`.
6. **For migrations:** read [migrations/README.md](migrations/README.md) before adding a step or migration.

### Tracing code across the repo

- **Oracle path (Solana source):** Solana `oracle-emitter` (Anchor) → Wormhole Core Bridge (VAA) → `mrelayer` → `OracleDispatcher` on Moonbeam (extends `MessageReceiver`) → `XcmTransactor` → Hydration oracle pallet.
- **Oracle path (Ethereum source):** `OracleEmitter` on Ethereum → Wormhole → (parallel) `OracleDispatcher` proxy on Moonbeam → `XcmTransactor` → Hydration. Each source chain has its OWN dispatcher + transactor proxy pair (renounced ownership = no shared infra).
- **Basejump path:** Source EVM `Basejump.sol` → Wormhole → `BasejumpProxy.sol` (Moonbeam) → `XcmTransactor` → `BasejumpLanding.sol` (Hydration). Fast-path is a separate signed VAA flow handled by `Basejump.completeTransfer`.
- **Intents path (WTT, deployed):** `IntentEmitterWtt.sol` (Hydration) swaps the user's asset → WETH, then via XCM `batch_all` (reserve-transfer WETH+GLMR to its Moonbeam MDA + Transact-as-MDA) approves the Wormhole TokenBridge and calls `transferTokensWithPayload(WETH, …, IntentReceiver, payload=(intentId, depositAddress, maxRelayFee))` — a single payload-3 VAA. Off-chain `mrelayer` (app-intent) sizes a relay fee via `quoter` and calls `IntentReceiver.redeem(vaa, feeRequested)` on Ethereum → unwrap WETH → native ETH → pay relayer (≤ `maxRelayFee`) → forward to OneClick `depositAddress`; emits `IntentForwarded`. `nintent` then nudges OneClick. The shared abstract `IntentEmitter.sol` base differs only in the `_bridgeViaWormholeCall` hook; the **BJP** variant (`IntentEmitterBjp` → `BasejumpProxy` → `Basejump`/`BasejumpLandingNative` → `IntentRouter`) is the pooled fast-path alternative, not deployed for intents.
- **Off-chain:** `broadcaster` reads Solana oracle state and signs `send_price` / `send_rate` instructions. `bjscan` indexes Basejump events from Moonbeam/Base/Hydration and exposes them via Fastify. `mrelayer` polls Wormhole for VAAs and submits them to receiver contracts.
- **Shared:** `@whm/common` exports `chains`, `ifs`, `wallet`, `args`, `migration`. Any change here affects all consumers.

### Validating changes

1. **Solidity:** `pnpm --filter @whm/contracts build && pnpm --filter @whm/contracts test`. For migration changes, run against `--env fork` end-to-end via `pnpm migrate:<name>:fork`.
2. **Solana:** `pnpm --filter @whm/crates-solana build && pnpm --filter @whm/crates-solana test`. For TS-mocha integration tests against a local validator, start it first.
3. **Agents:** `cd agents/<pkg> && pnpm build` then `pnpm dev` against a local fork/validator.
4. **After Solana program changes that touch IDL:** `cd agents/broadcaster && pnpm sync-idl` to refresh `src/emitter/idl.json` and `src/emitter/types.ts`.

### What NOT to break

- **Do not edit prod state files under `deployments/prod/`** — they're the audit record of renounced/immutable deployments. Reconstruct manually from chain state if absolutely needed.
- **Do not skip migration step ordering** — `NNN-*.ts` numbering is load-bearing. To insert a step, renumber carefully; `--from` re-runs from a step onward.
- **Do not bypass the migration runner** with ad-hoc deploy scripts — the runner is the single source of truth for crash safety, resume, and audit.
- **Keep contracts upgradeable-safe** — they inherit OZ UUPS upgradeable; never add state-init constructors; respect storage layout when adding fields.
- **Do not commit `.env`** (gitignored). `.env.<context>` templates are checked in (no secrets, just RPCs).
- **Do not add a TS toolchain dep (`typescript`/`tsx`/`esbuild`/`dotenv`/`@types/*`) to an agent's `package.json`** — those live in the **root** and resolve upward. Agents declare runtime deps only.
- **`broadcaster`, `scan`, and `nintent` bundle to CJS** via esbuild — avoid top-level await or ESM-only constructs in `src/`.
- **Sync IDL/types before merging Solana program changes** — `broadcaster` will silently break against outdated types.
- **Don't add `ctx.ref` cross-migration calls** — that pattern was removed. Cross-deployment dependencies go through env-config copies.
