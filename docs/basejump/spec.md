# Basejump

## Abstract

A Wormhole NTT transfer takes ~13 min to reach guardian finality. Users want their tokens now.
Basejump pays them immediately out of a pre-funded pool on the destination, and lets the slow
settlement replenish that pool in the background.

Funds move on two rails between exactly two chains: an **NTT settlement** carrying the gross amount
to the pool, and an **instant message** carrying the net amount that pays the user. The difference
between the two legs is the fee, which accrues in the pool.

## Scope

- Inbound only: Base → Hydration. Outbound (Hydration → EVM) is out of scope.
- Single token: EURC — the **only** token with a Base NTT leg, so the Base deployment is effectively
  single-token. Every other EVM-railed token hubs on Ethereum.
- Ethereum → Hydration is the same shape with different constants, and needs no new Hydration
  deployment. See [Adding a corridor](#adding-a-corridor).

## Architecture

Three contracts, one per role. Each end is its own contract, so neither carries the other's
entrypoints — the corridor is inbound-only by compiler, not by configuration.

| Contract | Chain | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`BasejumpEmitter`](../../contracts/src/basejump/BasejumpEmitter.sol) | Base | Source. `bridgeViaWormhole` — NTT settlement + fast-path message |
| [`BasejumpReceiver`](../../contracts/src/basejump/BasejumpReceiver.sol) | Hydration | Receiver. `completeTransfer` — verifies the VAA, calls the landing |
| [`BasejumpLanding`](../../contracts/src/basejump/BasejumpLanding.sol) | Hydration | Pre-funded pool. Pays the recipient, retains the fee |

`BasejumpReceiver` extends [`MessageReceiver`](../../contracts/src/MessageReceiver.sol) for VAA
verification, replay protection, and the authorized-emitter check. `BasejumpEmitter` is standalone
UUPS — it has no receive path to inherit. Both implement
[`IBasejumpPayload`](../../contracts/src/basejump/interfaces/IBasejumpPayload.sol), the only thing
the two ends share.

                                              → currencies.transfer
                                              → recipient (AccountId32)
```

## Flow

### Source — `bridgeViaWormhole(asset, amount, recipient, data)`

Returns `(transferSequence, messageSequence)`.

1. Reject `amount == 0`; reject if `landing` is unset (`LandingNotSet`).
2. Reject if `nttManagerFor[asset]` is unset (`SettlementRouteNotSet`).
3. Pull `amount` with balance-delta measurement (fee-on-transfer safe) → `actualAmount`; reject if
   it arrives as zero (`ZeroAmountReceived`).
4. **Settle**: `quoteDeliveryPrice(DEST_CHAIN_ID, hex"00")`, `forceApprove`, then
   `INttManager.transfer{value: price}(actualAmount, DEST_CHAIN_ID, landing)` → `transferSequence`.
5. **Fast-track**: `_fastTrack` publishes `abi.encode(TransferPayload)` at consistency level
   **200** → `messageSequence`, and emits `BridgeInitiated`.

Settlement precedes publication, and the 3-argument NTT `transfer` overload hardcodes
`shouldQueue = false`. A rate-limit breach or paused rail therefore reverts the whole call before any
message exists — **a payout can never outrun its settlement.**

`msg.value` must cover `deliveryPrice + wormhole.messageFee()`: the settlement's delivery price and
the fast-path publish are both paid from it.

`quoteDeliveryPrice` requires `hex"00"` (a zero-count prefix) for transceiver instructions; empty
`bytes` reverts `LengthMismatch(0,1)`.

### Receiver — `completeTransfer(vaa)`

`parseAndVerifyVM` → replay check → `authorizedEmitters[sourceChain]` → decode `TransferPayload` →
`IBasejumpLanding.transfer(sourceAsset, amount, recipient, data)`, all in one transaction.

### Landing — `transfer(sourceAsset, amount, recipient, data)`

Resolves `destAssetFor[sourceAsset]`. If the pool balance suffices, dispatches `currencies.transfer`
through the `0x0401` precompile (pallet 79, call 0; `currencyId = uint32(uint160(destAsset))`);
otherwise it **queues** a `PendingTransfer` (FIFO), drained by `fulfillPending()`.

`data` is accepted and discarded. It exists for a future corridor whose `recipient` is a contract
needing Hydration-side action once funds land — an inbound intent. Reaching a callback needs the
landing upgraded first.

## Wire format

The fast-path message is `abi.encode(TransferPayload)`:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sourceAsset` | `address` | Asset pulled on the source; the landing resolves it locally |
| `amount` | `uint256` | **Net** — gross minus `assetFee`. The settlement delivers gross to the pool |
| `recipient` | `bytes32` | AccountId32 on Hydration |
| `transferSequence` | `uint64` | The NTT manager's sequence for the settlement that replenishes this payout — the correlation key between the two rails |
| `data` | `bytes` | Opaque, forwarded end-to-end |

## Storage and admin

| Slot | Contract | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `landing` | `BasejumpEmitter` | settlement recipient on the destination (bytes32) |
| `nttManagerFor[asset]` | `BasejumpEmitter` | settlement rail, per asset |
| `assetFee[asset]` | `BasejumpEmitter` | fee withheld from the fast leg, per asset |
| `landing` | `BasejumpReceiver` | landing pool on *this* chain (bytes32) |

Setters are `onlyOwner`: `setLanding`, `setNttManager`, `setAssetFee` on the emitter; `setLanding`
and `setAuthorizedEmitter` on the receiver. The landing has `setAuthorizedBridge`, `setDestAsset`,
and `withdraw`.

The destination chain id is the constant `DEST_CHAIN_ID = HydrationConsts.WORMHOLE_CHAIN_ID` (73),
not storage: `landing` is a single slot, so one source deployment already serves exactly one
destination, and a configurable chain id could never be changed independently of it. Retargeting
means a new implementation, not a setter call. `nttManagerFor` is per-asset because NTT managers are
per-token.

## Invariants

1. **Pool binding.** The emitter's `landing` must equal `pad(receiver.landing())`. Two slots on two
   chains, and *nothing on-chain checks they agree.* If they diverge, the payout pool drains while
   the other address silently accumulates gross. Steps 002 and 007 both write it from one
   `HYDRATION_LANDING` env value, so divergence needs a mid-migration edit rather than a mis-copied
   address — still verify on chain before the pool authorizes the receiver.
2. **Fail-closed settlement.** A settlement failure reverts the whole call before publication.
3. **No outbound on the receiver.** `BasejumpReceiver` declares no `bridgeViaWormhole`, no
   `nttManagerFor`. Enforced by the compiler.
4. **Atomic delivery.** A landing revert rolls back `receiveMessage`, leaving `processedVaas[hash]`
   false so the relay retries. Because both ends of the delivery are on one chain, there is no
   failure mode where the VAA is consumed but the funds did not move — and so no owner power to
   replay a VAA is needed.
5. **A shortfall does not revert.** Invariant 4 covers misconfiguration, not an empty pool: the
   landing queues and consumes the VAA. Nothing calls `fulfillPending()` automatically. Alarm on
   `pendingTail - pendingHead > 0`.
6. **Corridor isolation.** The receiver authorizes exactly one emitter per source chain.

## Configuration

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Hydration chain id / EVM chain id | `73` / `222222` |
| Hydration message core | `0x3792a6d63c31941B2805181771795D9176fA82A1` (`messageFee` 0, guardian set 7, 19 keys) |
| Base chain id | `30` |
| EURC (Base) | `0x60a3E35Cc302bFA44Cb288Bc5a4F316Fdb1adb42` |
| EURC (Hydration, asset 44) | `0x000000000000000000000000000000010000002c` |
| NTT manager (Base, LOCKING) | `0xD1dc3517732c98502b5c1ba2389AcA9E9016d89a` |
| NTT manager (Hydration, BURNING) | `0x8dd1286A29df5a2785fb638d6fb1598144cfbc4c` |
| `assetFee[EURC]` | `100000` (0.1 EURC) |
| Base TC Safe (emitter owner) | `0xD557AeAf1e0cB3D226BfF3B7a10C2cdA9dA081E7` |
| Hydration TC (receiver + landing owner) | `0xaa7e0000000000000000000000000000000aa7e1` |

**Rate limits** (read live): outbound 100,000 EURC per 24 h sliding window; inbound
184,467,440,737 EURC with `rateLimitDuration` 86400 — effectively unlimited. `quoteDeliveryPrice`
returns 0 on this route. Note `getCurrentInboundCapacity()` reverts on the deployed Hydration
manager; read `getInboundLimitParams(30)` instead, which returns packed `TrimmedAmount`s
(`amount = raw >> 8`, `decimals = raw & 0xff`).

## Deployment

One migration, [`basejump-base`](../../migrations/definitions/basejump-base/), covering both ends.
The landing is the existing pool `0x70e9b12c…df976`, so nothing is discovered across chains and no
address is copied by hand.

| Steps | Chain | Wallet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `001-deploy-emitter` → `002-set-landing@emitter` → `003-set-eurc-ntt-manager@emitter` → `004-set-eurc-fee@emitter` | Base | `ctx.wallet.base` (`PK`) |
| `005-deploy-receiver` → `006-set-emitter@receiver` → `007-set-landing@receiver` | Hydration | `ctx.wallet.hydration` (`PK_HYDRATION`) |
| `008-transfer-ownership@receiver` → `009-transfer-ownership@emitter` | both | — |

```
1. pnpm migrate:basejump-base                        # start to finish, ends TC/Safe-owned
2. verify invariant 1 across both chains
3. TC: landing.setAuthorizedBridge(<receiver>, true) # ← go-live switch
4. TC: revoke any previously authorized bridge on the pool
5. relay on  →  canary
```

Step 006 reads the emitter address straight from `ctx.outputs["001-deploy-emitter"]`, so the two
ends cannot be wired to different deployments — a fresh emitter deploy is a new Wormhole emitter, and
an env-copied address would silently authorize a stale one.

The migration does not touch the landing: it is already TC-owned, already mapped
`EURC -> asset 44`, and already funded. Three consequences:

**The TC call in step 3 is the go-live switch.** Until it lands, a delivered VAA reverts at
`onlyAuthorizedBridge`, `processedVaas[hash]` rolls back, and the relay retries — so steps 1–2 are
safe to run early and the corridor simply stays dark. Nothing is at risk in between.

**Previously authorized bridges stay authorized.** Disarming an old source stops new VAAs but does
not revoke its authorization on the pool — hence step 4 in the same TC batch.

**Liquidity is continuous.** Reusing the pool means no funding step and no drain-and-refill window.

The Hydration deployer key needs an `EVMAccounts.ContractDeployer` slot; a chopsticks fork does not
enforce this, so a fork run does not validate it.

## Relaying

Two legs, two different needs:

- **Settlement** — the NTT VAA is delivered to Hydration by the `hydration-ntt` feature in
  [`agents/relayer`](../../agents/relayer/), which already carries the EURC route.
- **Fast path** — **not implemented.** Nothing currently delivers the emitter's instant message to
  `BasejumpReceiver.completeTransfer`. Needs a `basejump` feature in the relayer: subscribe to the
  source emitter, submit to the receiver. `fulfillPending()` also needs a keeper.

## Test coverage

Split by what each layer can actually observe.

| Layer | Covers | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`BasejumpEmitterTest`](../../contracts/test/basejump/BasejumpEmitterTest.sol) | fail-closed settlement, `SettlementRouteNotSet`, disarm-before-pull, delivery-price forwarding, no stale approval | mutation-checked: publishing before settling breaks it |
| [`BasejumpLandingTest`](../../contracts/test/basejump/BasejumpLandingTest.sol) | pool accounting, queueing, `fulfillPending`, authorization | `0x0401` mocked |
| [`BasejumpIntegrationTest`](../../contracts/test/integration/BasejumpIntegrationTest.sol) | emitter → receiver → landing, fee split, pool binding, atomicity, replay, queueing | `0x0401` is `vm.mockCall`'d, so **balances do not move here** |
| [`_probeBasejumpDelivery`](../../chopsticks/probes/_probeBasejumpDelivery.ts) | real message core, real asset-44 precompile, real `0x0401` dispatch, real balance movement, replay, shortfall | Substrate fork |

Foundry cannot execute the delivery leg: the asset-44 ERC20 and `0x0401` are Substrate runtime
precompiles, not EVM bytecode, so an EVM fork sees empty code and the landing reverts on its first
`balanceOf`. Only chopsticks runs them. The probe uses the **real deployed** core and substitutes
only the guardian *set* (via `dev_setStorage` into `EVM.AccountStorages`) so it can sign a VAA the
real `parseAndVerifyVM` accepts — the verification path itself is untouched.

## Adding a corridor

`authorizedEmitters` is keyed by source chain and Hydration has one landing, so one receiver serves
every corridor. Ethereum → Hydration needs:

1. Hydration TC: `receiver.setAuthorizedEmitter(2, pad(<eth emitter>))` and
   `landing.setDestAsset(<eth USDC>, <hydration asset>)`.
2. A `basejump-ethereum` migration mirroring steps 001–004 — only constants differ (manager
   `0x447b2c7485A3d6813F8197E605b10BcCD8dd8398`, USDC `0xA0b86991…eB48`, Hydration asset 21
   `0x…0100000015`). A new source deployment is required: the Base contract is a Base-specific
   emitter wired to the Base EURC manager.
3. One entry in the relayer's route list.
4. Fund the pool.

No `setAuthorizedBridge`, so a new corridor adds no trust surface on the pool. To wire a second
corridor before the ownership handover, pause `basejump-base` before step 008 and append the extra
emitter step — the runner permits appending steps, not editing or reordering.

## Adding a token

`nttManagerFor` is per-asset, so adding a token to an existing source deployment is one owner call
— **but only if that token has an NTT manager on that same source chain.** That is the binding
constraint, and it is narrow. Live NTT legs:

| Token | Hub (locking) | Decimals | Addable to a Base deployment? | To an Ethereum one? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EURC | Base | 6 | already the route | no leg |
| USDC | Ethereum | 6 | **no Base leg** | yes — one owner call |
| USDT | Ethereum | 6 | **no Base leg** | yes — one owner call |
| WBTC | Ethereum | 8 | **no Base leg** | yes — one owner call |
| DAI / sUSDS / WETH | Ethereum | 18 | **no Base leg** | blocked on the dust gate below |
| SOL / jitoSOL / PRIME | Solana | — | n/a | n/a (non-EVM source) |

So the per-asset mapping buys nothing on Base — EURC is the only Base-railed token and will be until
someone stands up another Base NTT route. Its value is on an **Ethereum** source deployment, where
six tokens share one chain and each additional one really is a single `setNttManager` call.

Standing up a new NTT route where none exists is not a Basejump change: it needs a manager plus
transceiver on the source chain, a burning-side manager on Hydration, bilateral `setPeer`, and a
Hydration runtime governance call `EVMAccounts.set_ntt_minter(assetId, manager)` (pallet 93, call 7)
— referendum-class. Basejump can only onboard NTT-railed tokens as fast as someone stands up NTT
routes.

**Dust gate on any token with more than 8 decimals.** NTT trims amounts to 8 decimals. EURC, USDC and
USDT are 6dp and WBTC is 8dp, so all four are exact. An 18dp asset (WETH, DAI, sUSDS) loses up to
`1e10` wei between the gross settlement leg and the net fast leg — a silent per-transfer pool leak —
and may revert `TransferAmountHasDust`. Before enabling one, either quantize `actualAmount` to the
trim granularity in `bridgeViaWormhole` or set `assetFee[asset]` at or above the maximum trim dust.
Not implemented.

**Indexer note.** `transfer_sequence` means the NTT per-manager `msgSequence` on this path, not a
chain-global sequence. `scan` keys rows on `` `init-${chain}-${transferSequence}` ``; with one
NTT-railed token per source chain the ranges do not collide, but a second token on the same source
chain makes two managers each count from ~0 and the `ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE` upsert silently
merges rows. Key on `messageSequence` before token #2 — which, per the table above, means before the
first Ethereum corridor carries more than one token.
