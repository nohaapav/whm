# relayer

Wormhole VAA relayer. Watches guardian-signed VAAs over a Spy stream and submits them to the
contract that consumes them, with Redis-backed retries and missed-VAA recovery from
[`@wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine`](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/relayer-engine).

## Apps

One app per process, one process per container. Each is its own entry point —
`dist/<app>/app.js` — so nothing is selected at runtime and there is no way to end up running the
wrong one. Each keeps its own engine app and its own Redis namespace.

### `ntt`

Redeems NTT transfers **into Hydration** from Ethereum, Base, Solana, and Sui. Watches the eleven
deployed origin transceivers ([routes.ts](src/apps/ntt/routes.ts)) and submits each transfer VAA to
that route's Hydration transceiver.

### `oracle`

Relays oracle price and rate VAAs **into Hydration**. Each source chain has its own OracleReceiver
deployment ([routes.ts](src/apps/oracle/routes.ts)); a VAA goes to the receiver for its source, which
verifies the emitter and writes the price in one call.

### `intent`

Relays intents **from Hydration to Ethereum**. Hydration settles WETH over NTT and publishes a
forwarding instruction beside it; this pairs the two and calls
`IntentReceiver.processOrder(nttVaa, instructionVaa, feeRequested)`, which delivers the settlement,
forwards it to the order's `depositAddress`, and reimburses the caller. The fee is measured, not
forecast — `estimateContractGas` on the real call at the order's own ceiling, priced at
`maxFeePerGas` — and is retried with backoff while it exceeds the order's `maxRelayFee`.

Only the settlement is subscribed to — the instruction is derived from the source transaction on
demand, so there is no pairing state to lose across restarts.

Its three addresses live in [routes.ts](src/apps/intent/routes.ts); the app validates them at
startup and refuses to run on a blank or malformed one.

## Configuration

Env holds only what changes between deployments. Routes, addresses, retry policy, backoff and age
caps are constants in each app's `config.ts` and `routes.ts`.

| Variable              | Description                                       | Default                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `PRIVKEY`             | Signing key. Same name everywhere — **see below** | Required                              |
| `RPC_HYDRATION`       | Hydration EVM RPC (chain `222222`)                | `https://hydration-rpc.n.dwellir.com` |
| `RPC_ETHEREUM`        | Ethereum RPC (`intent` only)                      | `https://eth.llamarpc.com`            |
| `SPY_ENDPOINT`        | Wormhole Spy endpoint                             | `localhost:7073`                      |
| `REDIS_HOST`          | Redis host                                        | `localhost`                           |

| `WORMHOLE_API_KEY`    | Wormholescan API key (raises rate limit)          | optional                              |

| `GAS_WARN_MULTIPLIER` | Warn below this multiple of one submission's cost | `50`                                  |
| `FROM_SEQ_<CHAIN>`    | Cold-start floor per chain — **see below**        | `0`                                   |
| `LOG_LEVEL`           | winston level                                     | `info`                                |
| `APP_NAME`            | Engine namespace override — **see below**         | per-app                               |

`PRIVKEY` is one name across every app, and the services still hold **different keys** — that is what
keeps the NTT, oracle and intent wallets off each other's nonce.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @whm/relayer dev oracle   # esbuild watch + run one app (reads .env)
pnpm --filter @whm/relayer redis        # local Redis
pnpm --filter @whm/relayer mainnet-spy
```

## Production

```bash
pnpm --filter @whm/relayer build        # → dist/{ntt,oracle,intent}/app.js
pnpm --filter @whm/relayer start:oracle
pnpm --filter @whm/relayer docker:up
```

One image; the swarm service names the entry point:

```yaml
app-oracle:
  image: galacticcouncil/relayer:latest
  command: [node, oracle/app.js]
```

## Notes

### The engine namespace is load-bearing

Every Redis key the engine writes derives from the app's `name`:

```
queue          {name}:{name}-relays
seen VAAs      {name}:missedVaasV3:seenVaas:{chain}:{emitter}
failed fetch   {name}:missedVaasV3:failedToFetch:{chain}:{emitter}
safe sequence  {name}:missedVaasV3:safeSequence:{chain}:{emitter}
```

Renaming orphans that state. The missed-VAA worker then falls back to the `FROM_SEQUENCE` floors and
rescans — replaying a backlog, or silently skipping everything before the floor. Each app's
`config.ts` carries the name already in Redis (`hydration-ntt-relayer`, `oracle-relayer`,
`intent-relayer`); `APP_NAME` overrides it, which is only for running a second deployment beside the
live one. Do not rename to tidy up.

The `FROM_SEQUENCE` floors only matter on a cold start. Once a `safeSequence` exists the engine reads
from there, which is why they can sit at `0`. Each entry defaults from `FROM_SEQ_<CHAIN>`
(`FROM_SEQ_HYDRATION`, `FROM_SEQ_SOLANA`, …), so a floor can be set at deploy time — but only before
a namespace's first run, since nothing reads it afterwards.

Set one when an app subscribes to an emitter that was already busy before the app existed. Otherwise
the missed-VAA worker walks the whole history, and on chain 73 that walk does not even terminate: the
guardian gRPC returns `code 13` rather than `code 5` for old Hydration sequences, so
`tryFetchVaa` throws instead of returning null, the sequences land in `failedToFetch`, and
`calculateLastSafeSequence` pins `safeSequence` to `failedToFetch[0] - 1` on every 30s cycle
forever. Wormholescan's REST API serves those same VAAs fine — it is only the engine's internal gRPC
path, which has no fallback, that fails.

### Retry budget vs age cap

Throwing from a handler is the engine's retry mechanism, not a crash: BullMQ fails that one job and
reschedules it with backoff. But it is bounded — after `retries` attempts the job lands in the failed
set for good. The intent app's backoff budget (~2h) deliberately exceeds its age cap (1h), so an
unprofitable order exits via the logged "stale" path rather than accumulating in `failed`. Raising
`MAX_VAA_AGE_MS` above the retry window would break that.

### Chain 73 and the engine's SDK

relayer-engine depends on `@certusone/wormhole-sdk`, which predates Hydration and has no chain 73.
`app.chain(73).address(…)` therefore throws `Unrecognized wormhole chainId`. The engine layer
registers handlers under the pre-encoded emitter key instead
([engine/emitter.ts](src/engine/emitter.ts)) — for an EVM chain that encoding is only the address
left-padded to 32 bytes. Everything else degrades gracefully: the TokenBridge middleware skips it, no
provider is built for it, and only a missed-VAA metrics label reads `undefined`.

One consequence: the engine prefixes `0x` onto a `sourceTxHash` only for chains its SDK recognises as
EVM, so chain-73 hashes arrive bare and are normalised in [engine/vaa.ts](src/engine/vaa.ts).

### Why dependencies are not bundled

`@certusone/wormhole-sdk` pulls the Injective/Cosmos SDKs, which have circular CJS requires and
re-exported TS enums esbuild cannot flatten — the bundle builds and then dies at load with
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Mainnet')`. So `packages: "external"`, and the
Dockerfile installs them.

Related: those same packages ship a broken range. `@injectivelabs/networks` asks for
`ts-types@^1.10.12` and resolvers pick `1.20.12`, which dropped the enum it needs — so
relayer-engine cannot load at all. `ts-types` is pinned to `1.10.12` in both
[pnpm-workspace.yaml](../../pnpm-workspace.yaml) (pnpm, local) and this package's `overrides` (npm,
Docker). Both are needed; keep them in step.
